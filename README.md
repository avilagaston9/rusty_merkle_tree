# rusty_merkle_tree

Implementation of a simple Merkle Tree in Rust.

## Introduction

Merkle trees are used in distributed systems for efficient data verification. They are efficient because they use hashes instead of full files. Hashes are ways of encoding files that are much smaller than the actual file itself. Currently, their main uses are in peer-to-peer networks such as Tor, Bitcoin, and Git. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to implement a basic Merkle Tree in Rust as a means of practicing the Rust programming language.

## Usage

**Note:** This repository is currently a work in progress and is not yet available for usage.
